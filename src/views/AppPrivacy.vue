	<h2>What is a cookie?</h2>
	<p>A cookie is a text file (often including a unique identifier), which contains small amounts of information that are sent to your browser and stored on your computer, tablet or mobile device. As well as first party cookies there may also be "third-party cookies" included on our site, placed on your browser from, for example, from third party advertisers. You can control your consent to these cookies through the cookie consent tool here.</p>

	<p>Whenever you are on our websites, there may be "session cookies" and "persistent cookies" operating. Session cookies are temporary and only exist while you're browsing our sites, whereas "persistent cookies" will remain on your browser (for a period defined by us) and will be activated again when you return to one of our sites.</p>

	<h3>How do we use Cookies?</h3>
	Cookies help us to improve our websites and the services delivered to you. Our websites use cookies to distinguish you from other users but they cannot by themselves personally identify who you are. Cookies are used to control the display of ads, track usage patterns, personalise our websites for you and collect information about our users as a whole.

	Certain cookies we use require your consent and others do not. We only ask your consent when legally required to do so.

	But I am not on a VICE branded website?
	Vice manages a network of different online publishers (the “Vice Digital Network” or “VDN”) on whose behalf we sell advertising space. This allows us to serve personalised ads to you on websites across the Vice Digital Network, with your consent.

	In order to do this we will collect personal data via cookies from the websites across the Vice Digital Network; this may include information on your age, geographical location, gender, likes or dislikes and your browsing and clicking behaviour. However this information will only be used by or on behalf of Vice – it will not be shared with the publishers within the VICE Digital Network.

	These are the types of cookies on VICE and VDN websites:
	Strictly necessary cookies: These are essential cookies required for the effective operation of our websites, including, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our websites.

	Performance cookies: These allow us to see how our websites are used. For example, we can recognise and count the number of users and see how users move around our websites when using it. This helps us to improve our websites so that, for example, users can easily find what they are looking for.

	Functionality cookies: These cookies are used to recognise you when you return to our websites. This enables us to personalise our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).

	Targeting cookies: These cookies record your visits to our websites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our websites and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.
